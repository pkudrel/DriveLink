# DoNotBuildToRoot
- Any build action shoudn not produce artefacts to root repo directory
- Produce to dist directory


## Agent Summary
*(added/updated by agent on resume; user text above remains untouched)*
- Goal: Prevent build processes from creating artifacts in the root repository directory
- Scope: Review and modify build configurations to ensure all output files are placed in a dist directory
- Constraints: Maintain existing build functionality while keeping root directory clean
- Success criteria: All build artifacts (JS files, CSS, maps, etc.) are contained within the dist directory
