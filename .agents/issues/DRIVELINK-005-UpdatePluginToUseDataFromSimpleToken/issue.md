# Update Plugin to Use Data from SimpleToken

Update the DriveLink plugin to seamlessly integrate with the SimpleToken CLI tool, enabling automatic token acquisition and credential management.

The SimpleToken CLI tool (DRIVELINK-004-SimpleToken) is now complete and provides a user-friendly way to generate Google Drive API tokens. The plugin needs to be updated to:

1. Automatically detect and use tokens generated by SimpleToken CLI
2. Provide seamless integration with the credential manager
3. Offer fallback mechanisms for manual token entry
4. Implement automatic token refresh using stored refresh tokens
