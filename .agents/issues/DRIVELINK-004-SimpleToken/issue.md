# SimpleToken


- I there simple way to get token?
- Only propsitions - right now

## Agent Summary
*(added/updated by agent on resume; user text above remains untouched)*
- Goal: Research and propose simpler methods for users to obtain Google Drive API tokens
- Scope: Explore alternatives to current OAuth setup, focusing on user experience improvements - conceptual phase only
- Constraints: Propositions must maintain security standards; complement existing token generator page
- Success criteria: Present viable options for simplified token acquisition with clear pros/cons analysis

## Potential Approaches
*(conceptual propositions for evaluation)*

1. **Pre-configured Service Account**: Provide a shared service account with limited scope
   - Pros: Zero user setup, immediate access
   - Cons: Shared quotas, potential security concerns, Google ToS considerations

2. **Simplified OAuth Wizard**: Step-by-step guided setup within the plugin
   - Pros: In-app experience, contextual help
   - Cons: Still requires Google Cloud Console setup

3. **QR Code Token Exchange**: Generate QR codes for mobile OAuth completion
   - Pros: Easier mobile flow, visual guidance
   - Cons: Requires mobile device, still complex setup

4. **Token Proxy Service**: Hosted service to handle OAuth complexity
   - Pros: Minimal user interaction, professional UX
   - Cons: Third-party dependency, privacy concerns, hosting costs

5. **Plugin Marketplace Integration**: Leverage existing OAuth providers
   - Pros: Trusted third parties, established flows
   - Cons: External dependencies, potential costs
